In this project, we will look at the improvement of data compression ratios by the use of LZW and Huffman encoding/decoding. We will study the different data compression techniques and the implementation of their encodings. Measure the performance of Huffman and LZW by measuring the various size of data. Then measure relatively improved performance in the case of hybrid compression for Huffman-based LZW.
Steps needed to achieve the goal:
1. Wire an algorithm which can add the Huffman encoding layer to the LZW technique.
2. Program software to implement the algorithm.
3. Labelling the branches for Huffman compression and creating a dictionary for LZW.
4. Apply the compression technique to various text files.
5. Comparing the performance for all three algorithms.
